# Zipping a Folder

## Description
This Python script compresses all files and subdirectories inside a specified folder into a `.zip` archive, preserving the folder structure.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
2. Save the script as `zip_folder.py`.
3. Run the script using the command:  
   `python zip_folder.py`
4. Enter the path to the folder you want to zip when prompted.

## Expected Input/Output
- **Input**: Path to the folder you want to zip.
- **Output**: A `.zip` file named after the folder in the same directory.

## Error Handling
- The program checks if the folder exists and is a valid directory.
- It handles permission errors and creates an empty zip file if the folder is empty.
